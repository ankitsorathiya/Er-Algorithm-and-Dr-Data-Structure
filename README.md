# Er-Algorithm-and-Dr-Data-Structure
I would like to introduce you to two of my friends
- Engineer **Algorithm**
- Doctor **Data structure**

While I was applying for software engineering role, most of the organization asked to solve core coding problems and I was able to solve them because of these two kind beings.

> To succeed in the coding rounds you must make these two as your friends!
- [x] Engineer Algorithm
- [x] Doctor Data structure

> You can get familiar to these two over the internet. Followings are my recommendation to start with
- [MIT Data structures and Algorithms] (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUl4u3cNGP61Oq3tWYp6V_F-5jb5L2iHb)

As you start learning these datastructures/Algorithm/problem solving techniques, You must require to practice them and My recommendation goes to 

- [x] [Hacker Rank](https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard)
- [x] [Hacker Earth](https://www.hackerearth.com/challenges/)
- [x] [Geeks for geeks](http://www.geeksforgeeks.org/)

## It is only matter of time and practice which will make you much better programmer than you are today!
